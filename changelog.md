Changes to my portfolio website:
JS wise:
    For my personal portfolio website, I added a video selection functionality to my Art page. I use Javascript to implement the functionality that allows users to click the video thumbnails on the left side of the video element(or below it when it is on a smaller viewport) to change to the corresponding video, its title, subtitle, and description. This section's functions are similar to youtube, so it will be fairly intuitive for the user to use. 
    Besides the Javascript code that I have written, I have also included third-party code from google analytics to monitor the traffic of my site.
CSS & HTML wise:
    Finished two additional pages Art and UI. Fully styled and interactable.
